    <!-- About Me Section -->
    <p>Having a cat in the family is very rewarding but is also a big responsibility. Luckily, answers to many of the
        questions that a pet owner may have can be found on the Internet. In this article, I describe some useful,
        interesting, and often enjoyable websites for cat lovers. Some of the sites contain miscellaneous information
        about cats.
        The others list toxic substances or describe first aid procedures, <a href="https://pethelpful.com">which are
            both very important topics for pet owners</a>.Although a website may have a helpful overview of a disease or
        pest problem, a sick or injured cat must see a veterinarian. The vet will offer expert advice as well as provide
        a diagnosis and treatment that are tailored for the pet's specific situation. The diagnosis and treatment are
        especially important if the situation is serious or an emergency.
        A pet owner should know the nearest location of an emergency vet and the times that their office is open.
